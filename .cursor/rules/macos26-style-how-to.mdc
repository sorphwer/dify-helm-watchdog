# macOS 26 Liquid Glass Style Guide

This guide defines the "macOS 26" Liquid Glass design language, characterized by physical volume, complex light interactions, dynamic morphing animations, and a complete absence of traditional borders.

## Core Philosophy

1.  **No Borders (`border-none`)**: Edges are defined solely by internal highlights and external shadows, simulating a thick, translucent material.
2.  **Liquid Physics**: Interactive elements behave like viscous, glowing liquid—morphing (scaling/blurring) during movement and settling without bounce (over-damped).
3.  **Complex Lighting**: Uses multiple layers of inner shadows (`inset`) to simulate surface reflection (top-left) and subsurface scattering (bottom-right).
4.  **Volume & Texture**: High saturation (`backdrop-saturate-150`) and heavy blur (`backdrop-blur-[14px]`) create a rich, crystal-like texture.

## Component Implementation

### 1. Liquid Glass Button

Buttons use a complex shadow stack to replace borders and create depth.

**Tailwind Utilities:**
```tsx
className="
  relative overflow-hidden rounded-full border-none 
  bg-black/5 dark:bg-white/10 
  backdrop-blur-[14px] backdrop-saturate-150
  
  /* Light Mode Shadows: Bright top-left highlight, soft bottom-right shade, subtle drop shadow */
  shadow-[inset_1px_1px_0_0_rgba(255,255,255,0.7),inset_-1px_-1px_0_0_rgba(0,0,0,0.05),0_4px_12px_rgba(0,0,0,0.05)]
  
  /* Dark Mode Shadows: Sharper, glassier highlights on both sides */
  dark:shadow-[inset_1px_1px_0_0_rgba(255,255,255,0.3),inset_-1px_-1px_0_0_rgba(255,255,255,0.1),0_4px_12px_rgba(0,0,0,0.2)]
  
  transition-all 
  
  /* Hover State: Lift up, intensify highlights and shadows */
  hover:-translate-y-0.5 
  hover:bg-black/10 dark:hover:bg-white/20
  hover:shadow-[inset_1px_1px_0_0_rgba(255,255,255,0.9),inset_-1px_-1px_0_0_rgba(0,0,0,0.1),0_6px_16px_rgba(0,0,0,0.1)]
  
  /* Active State: Press down */
  active:translate-y-0 active:scale-95
"
```

**Volume Gradient (Inner Element):**
Add an absolute positioned child to simulate internal light refraction.
```tsx
<span className="
  absolute inset-0 -z-10 
  bg-[radial-gradient(circle_at_top_left,rgba(255,255,255,0.4),transparent_50%),radial-gradient(circle_at_bottom_right,rgba(255,255,255,0.1),transparent_50%)] 
  opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity
" />
```

### 2. Morphing Tab Indicator

The active tab indicator behaves like a sliding drop of liquid light.

**Container:**
Minimalist groove to let the indicator shine.
```tsx
<div className="relative flex w-full justify-center rounded-full bg-muted/50 p-1">
  {/* Tabs... */}
</div>
```

**Indicator (Motion Component):**
Uses `framer-motion` for the liquid morphing effect.

**Visual Style:**
```tsx
className="
  absolute inset-0 rounded-full 
  bg-primary 
  /* Strong glass edges + colored drop shadow */
  shadow-[inset_1px_1px_0_0_rgba(255,255,255,0.4),inset_-1px_-1px_0_0_rgba(0,0,0,0.2),0_4px_12px_rgba(0,0,0,0.3)] 
  backdrop-blur-md
"
```

**Animation Physics:**
- **Scale**: Expands to 115% mid-flight to simulate surface tension.
- **Filter**: Blurs (12px) and Brightens (200%) during fast movement (Motion Blur + Flash).
- **Timing**: Fast attack (35% to peak), over-damped spring (no bounce).

```tsx
<motion.div
  initial={{ scale: 1, filter: "blur(0px)" }}
  animate={{ 
    // Morph: Expand -> Contract
    scale: [1, 1.15, 1],
    // Effect: Clear -> Motion Blur + Flash -> Clear
    filter: ["blur(0px) brightness(1)", "blur(12px) brightness(2)", "blur(0px) brightness(1)"] 
  }}
  transition={{
    layout: {
      type: "spring",
      stiffness: 350, // High stiffness
      damping: 40,    // Over-damped (Critical damping ~37.4)
    },
    scale: {
      duration: 0.25,
      ease: "easeInOut",
      times: [0, 0.35, 1] // Peak early at 35%
    },
    filter: {
      duration: 0.25,
      ease: "easeInOut",
      times: [0, 0.35, 1]
    }
  }}
>
  {/* Inner Volume Gradient */}
  <div className="absolute inset-0 rounded-full bg-[radial-gradient(circle_at_top_left,rgba(255,255,255,0.25),transparent_60%),radial-gradient(circle_at_bottom_right,rgba(255,255,255,0.1),transparent_60%)]" />
</motion.div>
```

## Usage Checklist

- [ ] Remove all `border-*` classes.
- [ ] Ensure `z-index` handling prevents clipping when elements expand (e.g., set container `z-30`, active item `z-20`).
- [ ] Check Light/Dark mode contrast for inner highlights (Light mode needs stronger white highlights, Dark mode needs subtler ones).
- [ ] Verify `backdrop-blur` and `saturate` are applied for that "thick glass" look.

CSS + SVG Apple iOS26 Liquid Glass Effect

Note: This effect is inspired by the "Liquid Glass" design language introduced in the fictional/future concept of iOS 26. It relies on SVG filters which may have varying support across browsers (Safari often has issues with feDisplacementMap on HTML elements).

Introduction

The "Liquid Glass" effect goes beyond traditional Glassmorphism (which is just blur + transparency). The core concept of Liquid Glass is "Blurred Background" + "Irregular Distortion". It looks as if you are viewing content through a glass of water that is slightly agitated.

Traditional frosted glass uses backdrop-filter: blur(10px);, which creates a uniform blur. Liquid Glass adds a refraction layer that warps the light passing through it, creating a more organic and physical feel.

We can achieve this on the web using an SVG filter (feDisplacementMap) to distort the element based on a noise texture.

1. The Principle

We use an SVG filter with the following primitives:

feTurbulence: Generates a random "noise" texture (fractal noise). This serves as the map for our distortion.

feGaussianBlur: Smooths out the noise so the distortion is liquid-like rather than jagged.

feDisplacementMap: Uses the smooth noise map to displace the pixels of the SourceGraphic (the element behind or inside).

2. HTML Structure

We need a container for our glass element and a hidden SVG that defines the filter.

<!-- The Liquid Glass Element -->
<div class="glass-container">
  <div class="glass-filter"></div>
  <div class="glass-specular"></div>
  <div class="content">
    Hello iOS 26
  </div>
</div>

<!-- The Hidden SVG Filter -->
<svg style="display: none;">
  <defs>
    <filter id="liquid-glass-filter" x="0%" y="0%" width="100%" height="100%">
      <!-- 1. Generate Fractal Noise -->
      <feTurbulence 
        type="fractalNoise" 
        baseFrequency="0.008 0.008" 
        numOctaves="2" 
        seed="7" 
        result="noise"
      />
      
      <!-- 2. Blur the Noise for smoothness -->
      <feGaussianBlur 
        in="noise" 
        stdDeviation="2" 
        result="map"
      />
      
      <!-- 3. Apply Displacement -->
      <!-- scale controls the intensity of the distortion -->
      <feDisplacementMap 
        in="SourceGraphic" 
        in2="map" 
        scale="70" 
        xChannelSelector="R" 
        yChannelSelector="G"
      />
    </filter>
  </defs>
</svg>


3. CSS Styling

The magic happens by applying the SVG filter to the element. Note that backdrop-filter currently doesn't support custom SVG filters in a standard way, so we often apply this to a background layer or the element itself to distort what's inside or use a specific layering technique.

body {
  margin: 0;
  height: 100vh;
  background: url('[https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1618005182384-a83a8bd57fbe?q=80&w=2564&auto=format&fit=crop](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1618005182384-a83a8bd57fbe?q=80&w=2564&auto=format&fit=crop)') no-repeat center center;
  background-size: cover;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

.glass-container {
  position: relative;
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  border-radius: 24px;
  overflow: hidden;
  
  /* Basic Glassmorphism base */
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
  box-shadow: 
    0 8px 32px 0 rgba(31, 38, 135, 0.37),
    inset 0 0 0 1px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  
  /* Flex center for content */
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  color: white;
  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, sans-serif;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  font-weight: 600;
}

/* Applying the distortion. 
   Note: In some implementations, this might be applied to a 
   pseudo-element or a specific background layer.
*/
.glass-filter {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  z-index: -1;
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px); /* Standard blur fallback */
  
  /* Apply the SVG Filter */
  filter: url(#liquid-glass-filter); 
}

.glass-specular {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  pointer-events: none;
  background: linear-gradient(
    135deg, 
    rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4) 0%, 
    rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05) 40%, 
    rgba(255, 255, 255, 0) 100%
  );
  border-radius: 24px;
}


4. How it Works

<feTurbulence>: Creates a cloud-like texture (noise). baseFrequency controls how "fine" or "coarse" the ripples are. 0.008 gives a slow, large wave effect.

<feDisplacementMap>: Takes the color values (R and G channels) from the noise map and shifts the pixels of your element (SourceGraphic) in X and Y directions.

scale: Increasing this value makes the liquid effect more "thick" and distorted.

Compatibility Note

Chrome/Edge: Good support.

Firefox: Generally good support.

Safari: Often struggles with feDisplacementMap applied directly to HTML elements or backdrop-filter. It might result in no effect or rendering artifacts.
