# macOS 26 Liquid Glass Style Guide

This guide defines the "macOS 26" Liquid Glass design language, characterized by physical volume, complex light interactions, dynamic morphing animations, and a complete absence of traditional borders.

## Core Philosophy

1.  **No Borders (`border-none`)**: Edges are defined solely by internal highlights and external shadows, simulating a thick, translucent material.
2.  **Liquid Physics**: Interactive elements behave like viscous, glowing liquid—morphing (scaling/blurring) during movement and settling without bounce (over-damped).
3.  **Complex Lighting**: Uses multiple layers of inner shadows (`inset`) to simulate surface reflection (top-left) and subsurface scattering (bottom-right).
4.  **Volume & Texture**: High saturation (`backdrop-saturate-150`) and heavy blur (`backdrop-blur-[14px]`) create a rich, crystal-like texture.

## Component Implementation

### 1. Liquid Glass Button

Buttons use a complex shadow stack to replace borders and create depth.

**Tailwind Utilities:**
```tsx
className="
  relative overflow-hidden rounded-full border-none 
  bg-black/5 dark:bg-white/10 
  backdrop-blur-[14px] backdrop-saturate-150
  
  /* Light Mode Shadows: Bright top-left highlight, soft bottom-right shade, subtle drop shadow */
  shadow-[inset_1px_1px_0_0_rgba(255,255,255,0.7),inset_-1px_-1px_0_0_rgba(0,0,0,0.05),0_4px_12px_rgba(0,0,0,0.05)]
  
  /* Dark Mode Shadows: Sharper, glassier highlights on both sides */
  dark:shadow-[inset_1px_1px_0_0_rgba(255,255,255,0.3),inset_-1px_-1px_0_0_rgba(255,255,255,0.1),0_4px_12px_rgba(0,0,0,0.2)]
  
  transition-all 
  
  /* Hover State: Lift up, intensify highlights and shadows */
  hover:-translate-y-0.5 
  hover:bg-black/10 dark:hover:bg-white/20
  hover:shadow-[inset_1px_1px_0_0_rgba(255,255,255,0.9),inset_-1px_-1px_0_0_rgba(0,0,0,0.1),0_6px_16px_rgba(0,0,0,0.1)]
  
  /* Active State: Press down */
  active:translate-y-0 active:scale-95
"
```

**Volume Gradient (Inner Element):**
Add an absolute positioned child to simulate internal light refraction.
```tsx
<span className="
  absolute inset-0 -z-10 
  bg-[radial-gradient(circle_at_top_left,rgba(255,255,255,0.4),transparent_50%),radial-gradient(circle_at_bottom_right,rgba(255,255,255,0.1),transparent_50%)] 
  opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity
" />
```

### 2. Morphing Tab Indicator

The active tab indicator behaves like a sliding drop of liquid light.

**Container:**
Minimalist groove to let the indicator shine.
```tsx
<div className="relative flex w-full justify-center rounded-full bg-muted/50 p-1">
  {/* Tabs... */}
</div>
```

**Indicator (Motion Component):**
Uses `framer-motion` for the liquid morphing effect.

**Visual Style:**
```tsx
className="
  absolute inset-0 rounded-full 
  bg-primary 
  /* Strong glass edges + colored drop shadow */
  shadow-[inset_1px_1px_0_0_rgba(255,255,255,0.4),inset_-1px_-1px_0_0_rgba(0,0,0,0.2),0_4px_12px_rgba(0,0,0,0.3)] 
  backdrop-blur-md
"
```

**Animation Physics:**
- **Scale**: Expands to 115% mid-flight to simulate surface tension.
- **Filter**: Blurs (12px) and Brightens (200%) during fast movement (Motion Blur + Flash).
- **Timing**: Fast attack (35% to peak), over-damped spring (no bounce).

```tsx
<motion.div
  initial={{ scale: 1, filter: "blur(0px)" }}
  animate={{ 
    // Morph: Expand -> Contract
    scale: [1, 1.15, 1],
    // Effect: Clear -> Motion Blur + Flash -> Clear
    filter: ["blur(0px) brightness(1)", "blur(12px) brightness(2)", "blur(0px) brightness(1)"] 
  }}
  transition={{
    layout: {
      type: "spring",
      stiffness: 350, // High stiffness
      damping: 40,    // Over-damped (Critical damping ~37.4)
    },
    scale: {
      duration: 0.25,
      ease: "easeInOut",
      times: [0, 0.35, 1] // Peak early at 35%
    },
    filter: {
      duration: 0.25,
      ease: "easeInOut",
      times: [0, 0.35, 1]
    }
  }}
>
  {/* Inner Volume Gradient */}
  <div className="absolute inset-0 rounded-full bg-[radial-gradient(circle_at_top_left,rgba(255,255,255,0.25),transparent_60%),radial-gradient(circle_at_bottom_right,rgba(255,255,255,0.1),transparent_60%)]" />
</motion.div>
```

## Usage Checklist

- [ ] Remove all `border-*` classes.
- [ ] Ensure `z-index` handling prevents clipping when elements expand (e.g., set container `z-30`, active item `z-20`).
- [ ] Check Light/Dark mode contrast for inner highlights (Light mode needs stronger white highlights, Dark mode needs subtler ones).
- [ ] Verify `backdrop-blur` and `saturate` are applied for that "thick glass" look.
